 Plant Growth Prediction Using CNN<br>
 • Developed a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict plant growth
 stages based on image data. Preprocessed images, trained the model on a categorized dataset (Stage 1,
 Stage 2, Stage 3), and optimized it with techniques like data augmentation and dropout.<br>
 • Achieved accurate classification and saved the trained model for further deployment. Implemented the
 project using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, with a focus on real-world applications in agriculture and
 plant monitoring.<br>
