HARVESTIFY<br>
The integration of machine learning (ML) with image processing and plant growth assessment technologies is transforming modern agriculture. By leveraging advanced image analysis in combination with ML algorithms, it becomes possible to predict plant growth stages with high precision. These intelligent systems empower farmers to make informed decisions regarding crop management, resource allocation, and harvest scheduling. The synergy between visual data and predictive modeling enables accurate monitoring of plant health and development phases. As a result, this approach enhances agricultural productivity, optimizes input usage, and contributes to sustainable farming practices. The adoption of such data-driven technologies holds the potential to create a more efficient, eco-friendly, and future-ready agricultural sector.
